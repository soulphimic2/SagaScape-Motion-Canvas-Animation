# **TypeScript Data Layer for SagaScape - Motion Canvas Animation Project**

## Overview

This project demonstrates my exploration of advanced TypeScript syntax by building a data layer for **SagaScape**, a digital study environment for Old Norse literature. Rather than creating a simple demonstration, I challenged myself to implement complex TypeScript features while developing an animated technical presentation using Motion Canvas—a TypeScript-based animation framework.

The software consists of two integrated components:
1. **A robust TypeScript data architecture** with interfaces, abstract classes, generics, and type guards designed to manage Old Norse dictionary data
2. **An animated presentation system** built with Motion Canvas that visually explains the technical implementation through four dynamic scenes

My purpose was to move beyond basic TypeScript usage and master advanced language features that improve code safety, maintainability, and developer experience. By combining data modeling with visual storytelling, I created a project that not only demonstrates TypeScript proficiency but also communicates complex technical concepts effectively.

## Development Environment

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x with strict type checking enabled
- **Animation Framework**: Motion Canvas 3.x for programmatic vector animations
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with Vite for hot-reload development
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code with TypeScript language server
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub for source management
- **Build Tools**: TypeScript compiler configured for ES2022 target with CommonJS modules

**Key Libraries**:
- `@motion-canvas/core` & `@motion-canvas/2d` - Animation framework
- `@types/node` - TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs
- Development tools: TypeScript compiler, Vite, and associated plugins

- [GitHub - Cleasby & Vigfusson Dictionary](https://github.com/stscoundrel/cleasby-vigfusson-dictionary) - Public domain dictionary data used in the project concept

## Future Work

- **Expand Dictionary Integration**: Implement real-time loading of the complete Cleasby & Vigfusson and Geir Zoëga dictionaries with proper API endpoints
- **Add Interactive Elements**: Convert the animation into an interactive tutorial where viewers can click through TypeScript concepts
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement code-splitting for larger animations and optimize render performance for complex scenes
- **Cross-Platform Export**: Extend export options to include GIF, MP4, and presentation formats like PDF/PPT
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Add Zod or io-ts for runtime validation that aligns with compile-time TypeScript types
- **Testing Suite**: Implement comprehensive unit tests with Jest focusing on type guard functions and generic class behavior
