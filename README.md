# **TypeScript Data Layer for SagaScape - Motion Canvas Animation Project**

## Overview

This project demonstrates my exploration of advanced TypeScript syntax by building a data layer for **SagaScape**, a digital study environment for Old Norse literature. Rather than creating a simple demonstration, I challenged myself to implement complex TypeScript features while developing an animated technical presentation using Motion Canvas—a TypeScript-based animation framework.

The software consists of two integrated components:
1. **A robust TypeScript data architecture** with interfaces, abstract classes, generics, and type guards designed to manage Old Norse dictionary data
2. **An animated presentation system** built with Motion Canvas that visually explains the technical implementation through four dynamic scenes

My purpose was to move beyond basic TypeScript usage and master advanced language features that improve code safety, maintainability, and developer experience. By combining data modeling with visual storytelling, I created a project that not only demonstrates TypeScript proficiency but also communicates complex technical concepts effectively.

## Development Environment

- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x with strict type checking enabled
- **Animation Framework**: Motion Canvas 3.x for programmatic vector animations
- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+ with Vite for hot-reload development
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code with TypeScript language server
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub for source management
- **Build Tools**: TypeScript compiler configured for ES2022 target with CommonJS modules

**Key Libraries**:
- `@motion-canvas/core` & `@motion-canvas/2d` - Animation framework
- `@types/node` - TypeScript definitions for Node.js APIs
- Development tools: TypeScript compiler, Vite, and associated plugins

## Future Work

- Redo this README as it was mostly written by AI and lacks personal insights and reflections on the development process
- Update the demo video with a more polished version that includes better animations and clearer explanations of the TypeScript features used
